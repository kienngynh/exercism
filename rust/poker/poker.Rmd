# Instruction
Pick the best hand(s) from a list of poker hands.

See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands) for an overview of poker hands.

+ Ranking a list of poker hands can be considered a sorting problem.
+ Rust provides the [sort](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.sort) method for `Vec<T> where T: Ord`.
+ [`Ord` types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html) form a [total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order): exactly one of `a < b`, `a == b`, or `a > b` must be true.
+ Poker hands do not conform to a total order: it is possible for two hands to be non-equal but has equal sort order. Example: `"3S 4S 5D 6H JH"`, `"3H 4H 5C 6C JD"`.
+ Rust provides the [`PartialOrd` trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html) to handle the case of sortable things which do not have a total order. However, it doesn't provide a standard `sort` method for `Vec<T> where T: PartialOrd`. The standard idiom to sort a vector in this case; is `your_vec.sort_by(|a, b| a.partial_cmp(b).unwrap_or(Ordering::{Less|Equal|Greater}));`, depending on your needs.
+ You might consider implementing a type representing a poker hand that implements `PartialOrd`.

# Let's solve it
## List of poker hand
First, let's research the poker games, I didn't play them before. According to Wikipedia, I see a table of hand-ranking categories. 

|Index|Name|Example|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Royal flush|10S JS QS KS AS|I think this is the best hand|
|2|Straight flush|JS 10S 9S 8S 7S|Hand contain five cards of sequential rank and same suite|
|3|Four of a kind|5C 5D 5H 5S 2D|Hand contain five cards in one rank and a card in another rank|
|5|Full house|6S 6H 6D KC KH|Hand contains three cards in one rank and two cards in another rank|
|6|Flush|JD 9D 8D 4D 3D|Hand contains five cards same suite, not all of the sequential rank|
|7|Straight|10D 9S 8H 7D 6C|Hand contains five cards of sequential rank and not all of the same suite|
|8|Three of a kind|QC QS QH 9H 2S|Hand contain one of three cards in the same rank|
|9|Two pair|JS JH 3D 3C 2H|Hand contain two of the double card in two other the same rank|
|10|One pair|10S 10H 8D 7C KH|Hand contain two cards in same rank|
|11|High card|KS QH 7D 4C 3H|Nothing|

* Todo-list
  + Determind detail card on hand
    - Rank of card
    - Suite of card
  + Sort categoria
    - Because the result is the best hand, not a list sorted. So, I want to use HashSet
    - Overview, HashSet will contain {Categoria:["hand1","hand2"]}
    - Pick the best category then pick the best hand in there, we have the result.
